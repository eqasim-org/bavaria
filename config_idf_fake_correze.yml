## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: C:/Users/arthur.burianne/Documents/tum/simulations/fake_correze_10_tmp

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  #- data.spatial.iris # implies codes, usefulll to generate fake data
  #- data.spatial.iris # implies codes, usefulll to generate fake data
  #- data.income.municipality # implies codes, usefulll to generate fake data

  - synthesis.output # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts

  # Some general configuration
  processes: 8

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
