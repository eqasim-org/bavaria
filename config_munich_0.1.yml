## Synthetic population pipeline for Munich
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: munich/cache

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  - synthesis.output
  - matsim.output

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration
  processes: 8

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
  hts: entd

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population
  sampling_rate: 0.1
  random_seed: 1234

  # Only interesting if you run the simulation
  # on the server, one can use up to 120GB of memory for the simulation, locally not more than 12GB makes sense usually
