## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: C:/Users/arthur.burianne/Documents/tum/simulations/fake_munich_10_tmp

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  - synthesis.output
  #- synthesis.population.sampled
  # - data.census.ipf_cleaned # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration
  processes: 8

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
  hts: entd

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population

  acquisition_sample_size: 1
  home_location_sampling: weighted
  regions: []
  departments: ["091"]
